# Insertionsort

1. Runs in θ(n²) in the average and worst case, but θ(n) in the best case (when the array is already sorted).
2. Modifies the provided array in-place and does not create a new array.
3. Works by building a sorted section of the array, inserting each new element into its correct position one at a time.
