# Sorting

The goal of these algorithims is to put a elements of a list in order.

## Formal Definition

---
Formally, the output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:

1. The output is in monotonic order (each element is no smaller/larger than the previous element, according to the required order).
2. The output is a permutation (a reordering, yet retaining all of the original elements) of the input.

## Simulation

In order for us to run the simulation and see how each sorting algorithim pefroms on various number of n,. [1,10,100,1_000,10_000,100_000,1_000_000]
run -> python .\sorting\main.py

## Example

---
[4,32,5,7,1,3] -> [1,3,4,5,7,32]
