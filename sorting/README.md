# Sorting

The goal of these algorithims is to put a elements of a list in order.

## Formal Definition

---
Formally, the output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:

1. The output is in monotonic order (each element is no smaller/larger than the previous element, according to the required order).
2. The output is a permutation (a reordering, yet retaining all of the original elements) of the input.
