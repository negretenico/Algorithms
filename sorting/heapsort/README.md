# Heapsort

HeapSort, the text goes into more detail about how to imporve the algorithim using a priority queue, that was not covered here.
possibly look into this as an enhancement in the future

   1. Uses a heap datastrucutre to achieve the sorting
   2. modifies the provided array and does NOT return a new array rather the modfified version of the given array
   3. Î¸(nlog(n)) where n is the size of the array
